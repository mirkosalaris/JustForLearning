# Stringy Shapes

### Description of the program
This program lets you draw stringy (and blinky) shapes. All you need to do is clicking around (at least 2 times to see something).
Three buttons: new shape, reset, red/blue.
What is a shape? A set of points. There will be a line between each pair of points.
Pressing new shape generates, unsurprisingly, a new shape.
Reset button, guess it, just resets the whole board.
Red/blue button, here you need a bit of imagination, change color of the shapes, switching between red and blue.

Look at `./example.gif`

### How is it realized?
I used Processing 3.  
The main file is `stringy_shapes.pde`, where the interesting code is and where you would like to look. The code is very very easy and small.

### Download
You find all the available downloads (Windows and Linux) inside `./download/`
